# MongoDB Write Conflict Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve MongoDB write conflicts (error code 112) that were occurring during user creation and subscription setup.

## Issues Identified
- MongoDB write conflicts during concurrent user creation
- Transaction failures when creating users and subscriptions simultaneously
- Insufficient retry logic for handling write conflicts
- Missing database connection optimizations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Improvements (`src/lib/db.ts`)
- Added `minPoolSize: 2` for better connection pool management
- Increased `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` to 10000ms
- Added `writeConcern` with majority write acknowledgment
- Added `maxIdleTimeMS` and `waitQueueTimeoutMS` for better connection handling
- Added `retryDelay` and `maxRetries` for automatic retry logic
- Enhanced connection event monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Retry Logic (`src/models/User.ts`)
- Increased max retries from 3 to 5
- Implemented exponential backoff strategy (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1600ms)
- Better error handling for write conflicts
- Improved logging for retry attempts

### 3. Subscription Creation Improvements (`src/models/Subscription.ts`)
- Added retry logic for subscription creation
- Added unique compound index to prevent duplicate free subscriptions
- Better error handling for duplicate key errors
- Exponential backoff for write conflicts

### 4. API Endpoint Enhancements (`src/app/api/users/route.ts`)
- Changed user creation behavior to return existing users instead of errors
- Better error handling for write conflicts
- More informative error messages

### 5. Utility Functions (`src/lib/db.ts`)
- Added `retryOperation` utility function for consistent retry logic
- Configurable retry attempts and delays
- Automatic handling of write conflicts

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Database Connection
```bash
node scripts/test-db-connection.js
```

### 2. Test User Creation
- Try creating multiple users simultaneously
- Monitor logs for retry attempts
- Verify that write conflicts are handled gracefully

### 3. Monitor Logs
Look for these log messages:
- "Write conflict detected, retrying in Xms... (attempt X/Y)"
- "User created successfully on attempt X"
- "User already exists, returning existing user"

## Expected Behavior
- Write conflicts should be automatically retried with exponential backoff
- Users should be created successfully after retries
- Existing users should be returned instead of errors
- Database operations should be more stable and reliable

## Monitoring
- Check application logs for retry attempts
- Monitor MongoDB connection pool status
- Watch for write conflict errors in production

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Load Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent user signups
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for write conflict frequency
3. **Database**: Consider MongoDB version upgrade if using older versions
4. **Scaling**: Monitor connection pool usage under load

## Troubleshooting
If write conflicts persist:
1. Check MongoDB server logs for catalog changes
2. Verify MongoDB version compatibility
3. Check for long-running transactions
4. Monitor database performance metrics
5. Consider increasing retry attempts or delays
