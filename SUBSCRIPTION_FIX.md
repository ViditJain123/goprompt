# Subscription Issue Fix

## Problem
User `f20220942@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in` completed payment successfully (subscription_id: `sub_3hoXhd6lhG9OY8xOB2rBS`) but the system is still showing the free plan instead of the paid subscription.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely that:
1. The DodoPayments webhook didn't fire properly or failed to process
2. The subscription was created but not linked to the user account
3. There's a race condition between payment completion and webhook processing

## Solution

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)
The system now includes automatic fallback logic. When you visit the payment success page, it will:
1. Try the main subscription API first
2. If that fails, automatically retry with the fix endpoint
3. Show an error message if both fail

### Option 2: Manual Fix via Browser Console
1. **Log in to the application** as the affected user (`f20220942@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in`)
2. **Open browser developer tools** (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. **Go to the Console tab**
4. **Run this code**:

```javascript
fetch('/api/subscription-fix', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    subscriptionId: 'sub_3hoXhd6lhG9OY8xOB2rBS',
    plan: 'monthly',
    forceUpdate: true
  })
}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
  console.log('Fix result:', data);
  if (data.success) {
    alert('Subscription fixed! Reloading page...');
    window.location.reload();
  } else {
    alert('Fix failed: ' + data.error);
  }
});
```

5. **Wait for the response** and page reload

### Option 3: Check Current Status
To check the current subscription status, run this in the browser console:

```javascript
fetch('/api/subscription-fix')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Current subscription status:', data));
```

## What the Fix Does
1. **Checks for existing subscription** with the external subscription ID
2. **Links existing subscription** to the user if found
3. **Creates new subscription** if none exists
4. **Updates user's currentSubscription** reference
5. **Returns updated subscription details**

## Prevention for Future
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. **Monitor webhook delivery** from DodoPayments
2. **Add webhook retry logic** for failed deliveries
3. **Implement idempotency** in webhook processing
4. **Add better error handling** and logging
5. **Consider webhook signatures** for security

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. The user should see their subscription plan updated (not "free")
2. The subscription limits should be applied (100 buttons for monthly)
3. The subscription end date should be visible in user profile

## Support
If the fix doesn't work:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check the server logs for subscription processing errors
3. Verify the subscription exists in the DodoPayments dashboard
4. Contact DodoPayments support if webhook delivery is failing
